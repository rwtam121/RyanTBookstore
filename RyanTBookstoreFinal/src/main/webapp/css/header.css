/*

All we did here is make some flexbox
containers, and gave some width to
the left and right header and footer
divs. A few lines of code made a huge
difference in the appearance.


previous background: black; now background: #93d355; for header now green

added
display: flex;
justify-content: space-between;
space between means if have three elements, one is all the way to left, other all way to right, other in middle

#leftHeader { width: 150px; }
#rightHeader { width: 150px; }

annotated document says that the header has to be 150px
in header.jsp we defined the left, mid and right headers as well.
That is why we took the element with a specific id (leftHeader, rightHeader, in css we put a hashtag before it to adjust
its properties). This puts mid header right in the middle so it is centered (a trick)

I also put 10px padding ON TOP of the logo and also on the logo text. This worked, it is responsive!

We also want to style the search box. Search form itself will become a flex container. See how many little magnifying glass
as the searchIcon is above the search box in the horiz alignment? The flex box of the search form (which encompassesthe box
and icon) will align them. We say display: flex,and by default this flexbox is in a row.

Want searchbox to be 300X35 pixels. The border for the searchbox establishes the rounded corners (ie 3 px) by setting the border radius
on the border.

Need to change the alignment in the search form because it contains the search box and search icon. To make sure they are aligned, since
the magnifying glass icon looks stretched. So align items-center centers the items, so not stretched vertically.

Also, justify-content needs to be centered for flexbox. Adding padding to the whole form as well at the left.

Making the line height the same as the height gets the text centered for the login button. The letter G now looks nice and centered within the circle
it is embedded in.

For all cart items, we want them to be a flexbox displayed along its center
NEED A FLEX DIRECTION for the right header because default is by rows, we want to flex by columns so it flares out vertically

Dr K tried moving the item number
    position: relative; for cartIcon

    and cartCount:     position: absolute;
    top: -10px;
    left: 15px;

    However, books with auto left and right margin fell into place (are now centered)

Not doing anything with mid header yet, just want to keep it there

Change header formatting:
prev bkgrd:     background: #93d355;
    color: white;

        display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;


    these were right header properties I took out:
        width: 200px;
    border: black 2px solid;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-around;

    no need for login button:

#loginButton{
    width: 40px;
    height: 40px;
    line-height: 40px;
    background: black;
    color: white;
    border-radius: 50%;
}

itemsArray once had these
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;

    justify-content: space-evenly;

    cartand Login
        align-items: center;

        leftHeader 150px; resizing might be tough

took this out
searchForm
    padding-left: 650px;

    leftHeader= width 150px

    header background     background: white;
